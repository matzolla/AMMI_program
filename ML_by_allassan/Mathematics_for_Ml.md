# Functional Analysis

#### Property of second derivatives
- greater than zero we have a `local maximum`
- less than zero, we have `local minimum`
- equal to zero `no information` and we have an `inflection point`


# Linear Algebra 

#### Properties of matrices
- given a matrix `A` or dimension `mxk` and a matrix `B` of dimension `kxn`, the only matrix that can be performed is multiplication `AB` to have dimension `mxn`.
- The hammadard matrix multiplication is perform element-wise and is given by `$\C_{ij}=A_{ij}*B_{ij}$`
- If a matrix is invertible we call it `a non-singular matirx`
- For square matrices, the property holds `(A^{-1})^{T}=(A^{T})^{-1}=A^{-T}`
- Given the equation `Ax=b` the solution to this equation can be given by the Moore penrose pseudo-inverse given by: `x=(A^{T}A)^{-1}A^{T}b` for singular matrices.
